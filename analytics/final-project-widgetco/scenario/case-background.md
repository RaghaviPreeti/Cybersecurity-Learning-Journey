# Case Background – Widget Co. Breach Simulation

Widget Co. is a fictional mid-sized enterprise that experienced a suspected cybersecurity breach in October.  
The organization provided a range of log data and asked for assistance in analyzing the potential incident.

## Objective
Analyze available log data to:
- Identify if a breach occurred
- Determine affected user accounts and systems
- Understand how the attacker gained access
- Provide evidence and timeline of events
- Recommend preventative measures

## Provided Data Sources
- **DNS logs**: To detect potential command-and-control or suspicious domains
- **VPN logs**: To track remote access attempts
- **MFA logs**: To identify login attempts with or without multi-factor success
- **Cloud services logs**: For access tracking and resource interaction
- **Password vault logs**: To monitor access to stored credentials
- **Internal app logs**: Including the IT Admin Portal and Billing System

## Investigation Goal
Use Splunk to ingest, query, and correlate logs across all sources, build a complete picture of the breach, and identify the attackers' movement across systems.

⚠️ This case scenario is fictional and was provided as part of an academic assignment in a cybersecurity analytics course.
