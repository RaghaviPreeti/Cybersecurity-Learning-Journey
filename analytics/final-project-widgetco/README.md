# Final Analytics Project – Cybersecurity Breach at Widget Co.

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world breach investigation for a fictional organization, **Widget Co.**, using Splunk as the primary tool for forensic analysis and threat detection. The objective was to identify indicators of compromise, trace attacker activity, and provide both technical and strategic recommendations to prevent future incidents.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Splunk** for log analysis, correlation, and visualization
- IOC-based filtering (IP/domain matching)
- MFA and VPN log analysis
- Timeline construction across applications and systems

## 📁 Project Structure
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scenario/` | Provided case background and project instructions |
| `report/` | Final PDF report submitted by the team |
| `queries/` | Core Splunk queries used during the investigation |

## Key Findings
- Breach confirmed via phishing, credential abuse, and MFA bypass
- Compromised accounts: **BDRVLS** and **DDDXUB**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive systems including Billing, Cloud, Password Vault, and IT Admin Portal
- Evidence of attacker persistence and use of evasive IP infrastructure

## Deliverables
- [Case Background](./scenario/case-background.md)
- [Final Report (PDF)](./report/Analytics_Final_Project_Report.pdf)
- [Splunk Queries](./queries/splunk-queries.md)

## 👥 Project Context
This project was completed as part of a team effort for the Cybersecurity Analytics course.  
The investigation and technical analysis were a collaborative effort.  
This repository was prepared by me to document and present the project for portfolio purposes.
