## My Role

I conducted the full investigation using Autopsy on a forensic image of a Windows system. I documented user behavior, constructed a timeline of events, and analyzed metadata to support a well-evidenced breach narrative.

The summary of my findings is available in `breach_summary_angela_housing.md`.
