## Summary

The investigation involved analyzing two disk images (one primary and one MacOS-based) using Autopsy. I performed disk imaging, file recovery, and metadata analysis to locate files that were intentionally renamed, embedded, or deleted. MD5 hashes were used to verify data integrity.

This exercise simulated a real-world forensic engagement and strengthened my practical skills in evidence recovery, data validation, and reporting. All artifacts and content presented here are fictional and part of an academic assignment.

A brief summary of the findings is included in report-summary.md
