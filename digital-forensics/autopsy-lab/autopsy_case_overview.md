This document outlines a forensic investigation conducted using Autopsy as part of a graduate-level digital forensics course.

> **Disclaimer**  
> This case study is entirely fictional. The subject, "Bob’s Art Studio", and all associated content are simulated for educational purposes. No real client data or private materials are included.

## Objective

- Recover intentionally hidden bearcat images and deleted flower photographs from a forensic disk image.
- Validate the forensic acquisition using MD5 hashing.
- Prepare documentation suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Summary

The investigation involved analyzing two disk images (one primary and one MacOS-based) using Autopsy. I performed disk imaging, file recovery, and metadata analysis to locate files that were intentionally renamed, embedded, or deleted. MD5 hashes were used to verify data integrity.

This exercise simulated a real-world forensic engagement and strengthened my practical skills in evidence recovery, data validation, and reporting. All artifacts and content presented here are fictional and part of an academic assignment.

A brief summary of the findings is included in report-summary.md
