## Key Findings

- Eleven bearcat images were successfully recovered from the disk.
- Five deleted flower photographs were restored from a MacOS image located on the clientâ€™s desktop.
- None of the images were permanently erased; rather, they had been:
  - Embedded within unrelated file types (e.g., PDFs, presentations)
  - Renamed to misleading formats (e.g., `.mp4`, `.hidden`)
  - Stored within compressed archives or document thumbnails
- The disk image and recovered files were validated using MD5 hash values to ensure data integrity.

## Conclusion

All requested images were recovered. The investigation found that the images had been deliberately obscured, but not destroyed. These actions appeared to be playful rather than malicious. The client was provided with all recovered photos and a technical appendix was created for internal documentation.
